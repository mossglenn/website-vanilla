# 🗂️ Scripts

This directory holds scripts that I use surrounding development for specific purposes.

Nothing in the scripts directory:

- should be needed for any file in the project structure,
- should not be needed for successful dev server previewing of the project,
- should not be needed to successfully build the project.
